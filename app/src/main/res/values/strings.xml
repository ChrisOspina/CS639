    <string name="bio">I am currently a graduate computer science student at Pace University and
        seeking opportunities to use the state-of-the-art technology to solve real-world problems.
        My journey with information technology started during my junior year in high school where
        I took course in computer technology to fulfill graduation requirements.
        From there I realized I wanted to pursue IT and software engineering as a career.
        At Farmingdale State College I took programming courses that covered aspects such as
        Database Systems, Web Development, Systems Analysis, UNIX Operating Systems,
        Algorithms and Data Structures. After my time at Farmingdale,
        I decided to continue my studies at the Seidenberg School of
        Computer Science and Information Systems. There I took even more classes and I am currently
        partaking in a Capstone project in anticipation of graduating this coming May.
